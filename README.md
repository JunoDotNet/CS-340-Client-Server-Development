# CS-340-Client-Server-Development


In this project, there are several different best practices followed when ensuring code is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. This practice became especially apparent when developing the CRUD Python module. One of the keystone methods of ensuring that code is optimal is using modular design. The modular design breaks down the program into smaller, self-contained modules that each handle specific functionality. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. My CRUD module allowed me to create a reusable, easily maintainable component that could be integrated into various projects, such as connecting dashboard widgets to a database.

In this project, it was crucial that I approached this course with a methodical and analytical process.  For the Grazioso Salvare project, this meant identifying specific database and dashboard needs. This was the first project that required me to develop a web dashboard. This process was frustrating in the beginning but the results were very much worth the trouble.
